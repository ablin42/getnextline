# get_next_line
#### This is the get next line project @ 42 Paris.

Whether it's from a file, the standard input, or even from a network connection later on, you'll need a way to read data one line at a time. Now is the time to write such a function, essential for several of your next projects.

#### The prototype is get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
The functions returns -1 if an error occured, 1 if it successfully read a line, and 0 if it reached the end of the file being read.
